# library-help-lti
Beta - early but stable development of a Library LTI that can be dropped into Canvas

## Installation

1. Rename /lti/\_custom to /lti/custom and upload the /lti directory to your server running PHP7.0 or greater and running https. You'll preferably want to do this in a development environment.
2. Go to https://yourdomain.com/lti/tools and follow the instructions.
3. You will be asked to update variables in the /lti/custom/config.ini.php file.
4. Update the config file in several passes, don't do it all at once. Just get it up and running, make changes, upload, test, make changes, upload, test, etc.
